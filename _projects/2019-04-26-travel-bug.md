Due to this being an unreleased, unannounced, closed-source project, there really isn't much I can say right now. I'll fill this page out as things are announced and I'll blog about it closer to release.

What I _can_ say right now is that Dart and Flutter are a dream to work with. I've tried other forms of cross-platform app development (looking at you, _Xamarin_) which felt like a constant uphill struggle, but Flutter development is a breeze by comparison. I was lucky enough to attend the Flutter conference where they went live with version 1.0 back in December, so Flutter is still fairly new tech. Despite that I've found it to be really reliable and development speed is pretty fast; If you've heard of Flutter before you'll have heard about its sub-second reload speed which is super nice when you're banging out UI.

That's all for now.
