I had the privilege of developing the Android edition of the the EPIC app while I was working with [Digisoft][digisoft]. EPIC is the [Irish Emmigration Musuem][epic] in Dublin.

It's a really nice looking app with a couple of really cool features, mainly the tour list and the _magic_ bit.

The tour list was inspired by the Ultravisual expanding cell list for iOS. You can find a tutorial for that over on RayWenderlich.com ([link][ios-tut-rw]).  
It's essentially a list whose topmost visible element is expanded and displays playback controls. You scroll the list, the elements shrink and expand to keep the topmost one expanded. There's also a little \*bump\* scroll that brings the topmost element back to be fully visible if you've just scrolled the top of it off the screen a little bit.

The rest of the user interface is pretty standard with hero animations and whatnot. I opted for [data binding][data-binding] over the usual `findViewById` nuisance, which worked out really well.

The _magic_ bit I referred to is how the app knows which area of the museum you're in and can offer to play the correct part of the audio tour! I can't divulge the method behind it but trust me, it's really cool!\*
