My past two years at Yakuto have been quite productive. I've worked on [Table Tennis Touch][ttt], [Darts Of Fury][dof], various in-house tools, and the crowning jewel that is [Ping Pong Fury][ppf].

It's fair to say that I've had my hands on every part of the codebase when it comes to both Table Tennis Touch and Ping Pong Fury. However, the area where I've had the most impact is the multiplayer networking (as you may well have guessed if you've read any of my posts on the subject). I developed a peer-to-peer solution using WebRTC as well as a client-server solution with Golang which, with some host tweaking, could handle a million requests per second on a single machine! ðŸ’ª

Ping Pong Fury is the first commercial game that I've worked on from start to finish, and I'm pretty damn proud of that.
