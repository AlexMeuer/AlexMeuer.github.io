In the year four of my course, each of us had to develop a game from inception right through to finished product. Each of us pitched our game to the lectures and rest of the class and, once approved, started designing and developing. We took an agile approach, even though it was a one-man project, using JIRA as task tracker and github to host it.

I chose to use Doxygen to generate a mini-site with all the documentation because I think it looks super nice. You can find that [here:rocket:][fyp-link].

This page is more of a stub than a proper page so I'll be fleshing it out more soon (before now it was just a redirect script, but they're no fun).
