>Allow me to break the ice...

In my final year of college we had to do a two-man project ([Davy Whelan][shovel-gh] and myself) for our _Artificial Intelligence for Games_ module. The resulting game had to be an asteroids clone with a focus on artificial intelligence. There was a bunch of stuff on the brief, which can be found on the [doxygen site][doxygen] for the project, but here I'll just go over the interesting parts.

##Planning
This project rivalled my [Final Year Project][fyp] in terms of planning.

##Architecture


##Ships


#Player

#SwarmBoids

>The suicidal nature of bees with the homicidal minds of wasps.

#Motherships

#Predators  

>Looking back, _Terminators_ would have been a more amusing name.

#Asteroids  

>That's right. Asteroids were ships two, albeit with little functionality.
