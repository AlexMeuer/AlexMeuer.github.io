    Started off doing embedded C/C++ and Java for set-top-boxes but
    quickly moved on to Android development in Java and Kotlin!

    We managed to get the set-top-box project down to zero reported bugs after a year of hard work; By then I had shifted more to server maintenance for the boxes.

    I'm proud to say I was the *Lead Android Developer* for the *EPIC (Irish Emmigration Museum)* audio tour app.
    One of my favourite parts of it is the fancy tour item list: as you scroll, the elements of the list expand and contract so that the one at the top of the screen is fully expanded and focused.
    The inspiration for it was a similar list by Ultravisual.<sup>(There's a tutorial blog post and accompanying gist in my backlog!)</sup>

    While working at Digisoft.tv, I became a *Certified C++ Associate Developer* through Pearson Vue and the C++ Institute.
    I wanted the Professional certificate but you have to get them in order;
    The associate exam is quite straightforward if you've been taught C++ before.

#    Since then, I've been back and forth over email with them about the issue where the *Certified C++ Professional Developer* isn't available to me despite obtaining the associate certificate;
#    I keep getting told to wait or retry the prep tests but it's been two years now...
#    Regardless, I haven't given up, I'll get those certificates!
