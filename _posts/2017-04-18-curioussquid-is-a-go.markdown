It's been almost a year since I finished college and I'm now beginning to develop seriously in my spare time!<!-- excerpt -->

I've done a few little experiments and spikes since college, but I haven't sat down properly to develop a game to completion. I recently moved home and am living with a good friend of mine from college: [Josh Mooney][joshmoo]. I know from our previous projects that we work well together; We click well with planning and execution. We decided to stop faffing about in C++ and Unity and just make something: Better to have a game in the store than thousands of prototypes or concepts in the discarded corners of our hard disks. In that vein, this evening we created a [GitHub organization][org-page] and a repo for our first game. We've already bashed out the core mechanics with prototypes and figured out our Minimum Viable Product.

We're developing in Unity with C# with the intention of releasing for mobile devices. We're going to keep it really simple, release and then iterate on it from there. We're using [Overv.io](http://overv.io) for task management because it integrates with GitHub in a super simple, uncluttered way. I've never made a complete game in Unity before, but I did all my networking practicals in it and I find it great for prototyping, so hopefully I can follow the best practices and avoid most of the rookie pitfalls. Here's hoping!

Anyways, I figured posting about it here will help me keep myself accountable.

When we have something real to show, I'll post it here. Until then: [**Watch this space!** :microscope:][rss]

:octopus: Oh, and why did we call it CuriousSquid? *[Larry the Curious Squid][larry]* was the working title I used for my college projects. It was a name I picked out of thick air and it was vague enough to fit pretty much any brief we were given!
