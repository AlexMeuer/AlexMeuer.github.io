I attended my graduation ceremony yesterday and now have a fancy piece of paper to prove my Bachelor of Science (First Class Honours) in Computer Games Development!

I think it all went pretty well. Photos were cringey but had to be done to please the family. I felt a little hollow that my dad wasn't around for it but that's just gonna be the case with events like this. Nevertheless, it was a fantastic occasion and a great chance to catch up with friends from college.

I'm glad I got the colour right! ;)
