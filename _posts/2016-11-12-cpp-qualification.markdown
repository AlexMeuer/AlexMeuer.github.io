I just became a _C++ Certified Associate Programmer!_<!-- excerpt --><br>
If you don't believe me you can view the certificate [**here**][certificate]!

I know, I know, it's not the _most_ prestigious achievement, but it's where you have to start with the C++ certifications; They won't let you tackle the more difficult ones until you've shown you can handle the easier ones.

The exam itself is pretty straightforward: _Can you read and understand this code? Yes? What does it output? Does it even compile?_<br>
It's not so much a test of how well you can program, it's more a test of how well you understand how the fundamentals of the language work. If you can follow some really convoluted statements, don't mind having single-letter variable names and you're not confused by pointers or inheritance, then the exam is a piece of cake. :cake:

I took the mock exam on the C++ Institute's website and walked into the exam the following week. It seems aimed at people who are self-taught or don't have any previous qualifications. I'm looking forward to the next one though; I'll actually have to study for it!
