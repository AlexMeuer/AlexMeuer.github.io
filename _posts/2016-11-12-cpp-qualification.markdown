I just became a _C++ Certified Associate Programmer_!<!-- excerpt -->

I originally wanted to take the _C++ Certified Professional Programmer_ exam, because I get excited by templates and meta-programming. However, you have to start at the bottom and the _associate_ cert is the first rung of the ladder.

The exam itself is pretty straightforward: _Can you read and understand this code? Yes? What does it output? Does it even compile?_<br>
It's not so much a test of how well you can program, it's more a test of how well you understand how the fundamentals of the language work. If you can follow some really convoluted statements and you're not confused by pointers or inheritance, then the exam is a piece of cake. :cake:
