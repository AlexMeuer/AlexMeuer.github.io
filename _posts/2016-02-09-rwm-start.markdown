Just finished making a quick prototype for Project 3 of our Real World Modelling (RWM) subject. The goal of RWM is to teach us (the students) about agile development in a practical, sprint based scenario. Projects 0 through 2 were week long projects but this one lasts for four weeks and sees us pick up a new team member.

As part of the overall planning phase, each person has to create a prototype of a feature that answers a specific design question. The question my prototype answers is: "Does a match-3 minigame provide a fun and engaging way of creating units?".

At first I was a little cynical: I didn't see how it could possibly answer yes to that question; however, with it completed, I actually think it could do quite well.

Whether or not it makes it into the game will be decided on how it fares in playtesting tomorrow morning...
