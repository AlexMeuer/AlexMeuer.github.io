I'm just home from work, it's just gone four o'clock (I finish early because I start early), and I'd like to explain why making stuff is the best.<!-- excerpt -->

When I say _making stuff_, I mean _willing something new into existence which didn't exist at all a short while ago_. I just finished a two week sprint where I had to create a Roku channel from scratch with zero prior experience. Before starting the sprint I had never even used a Roku device before, let alone programmed in Brightscript! However, now our company has a neat-o Roku channel that does some pretty fancy-shmancy stuff involving streaming and dynamic branding. :wink:

If you're reading this and have no idea what the heck Roku or BrightScript may be, allow me to enlighten you. A Roku device is a streaming dongle that you plug into your telly, just like a Chromecast device; Brightscript is the special-snowflake scripting language used to write apps for Roku devices, just like HTML and Javascript for Chromecast devices!

Back on topic: My point is that the feeling of making something that you perhaps struggled with at first but is now fully-fledged and functioning properly is a fantastic feeling. It's elation that lasts all day. It's most of the reason I code! The bigger and better the thing made, the greater the feeling of accomplishment for doing it. I suppose that goes for pretty much all accomplishments, but programming is how I get my fix.

I'll keep moving on to bigger and badder projects, all the hard work and tribulations are always totally worth it.

Alex, out.
