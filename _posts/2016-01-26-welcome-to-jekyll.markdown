![JEKYLL CHEEVO!][jekyll-logo]<br>
I have just upgraded my site to [Jekyll][jekyll-home]!
Instead of having a site and separate blog, I've decided to switch to jekyll; It looks super interesting and gives me yet another excuse to boot into ubuntu.
I'll be building this site up in small increments (during my breaks from coding my [Final Year Project][fyp-gh]), but the fact that I can use markdown will mean I can get content out faster (as opposed to writing the html by hand or using blogger's wysiwyg editor).
