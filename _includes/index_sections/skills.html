                                  C++ is my bread and butter. I started C++ in my second year of college and it remains my go-to for large projects. I try to keep up-to-date and watch C++ Weekly (Jason Turner's podcast) whenever I can. I don't get to use it professionally as much as I'd like.</p>

                                  C# was the first programming language I learnt. I started out with WinForms in first year of college and moved on to the XNA framework for 2D and 3D game development.</p>

I started Java in college, using it almost exlcusively for multithreading and pattern assignments. Since college, I've written Java that runs on tens of thousands of set-top-boxes and I continue to use it for Android development when Kotlin is not an option.</p>

                                  I used Unity in college but they did a good job of keeping the focus off of any specific game engine. We used Unity primarily for networking assignments; This was to keep the focus on the networking code itself and not on building a game, we didn't use any of the built-in networking help that Unity offers.</p>

                                  I wasn't going to have a git section and for a long time it wasn't on my CV either. However, then I realized that git it not common knowledge among all developers and is not taught in what I think is a frighteningly high percentage of development courses, given its almost global necessity! But yeah, I git. I can branch, rebase, cherrypick, resolve conflicts; all that good stuff.</p>
